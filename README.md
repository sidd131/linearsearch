Linear Search is defined as a sequential search algorithm that starts at one end and goes through each element of a list until the desired element is found, otherwise the search continues till the end of the data set.
 Complexity Analysis of Linear Search:
Time Complexity:

Best Case: In the best case, the key might be present at the first index. So the best case complexity is O(1)
Worst Case: In the worst case, the key might be present at the last index i.e., opposite to the end from which the search has started in the list. So the worst case complexity is O(N) where N is the size of the list.
Average Case: O(N)
Auxiliary Space: O(1) as except the variable to iterate through the list, no other variable is used.
